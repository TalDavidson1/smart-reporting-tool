# Smart Reporting Tool

## Project Description

The Smart Reporting Tool is an advanced reporting software that connects to various data sources and uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret user questions and generate visualizations.

### Key Features:
- Connects to various data sources (initially Excel files, with plans to expand to SQL databases)
- Uses NLP to interpret user queries and generate relevant visualizations
- Backend built with FastAPI for efficient API development
- Frontend developed using React with a powerful visualization library (D3.js or Chart.js)
- Initial focus on Excel files with columns: Date, Product, Sales
- Sample query: "What was the total sales for Product A in January?"

### Future Expansion Plans:
- Connect to various SQL databases (MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Azure)
- Design system for scalability to accommodate multiple data sources
